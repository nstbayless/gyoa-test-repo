Hello! You probably came to this page because you were wondering what the heck this is you're looking at.

This is *crowd-written interactive fiction*. Basically, you read a story assembled by a bunch (n&gt;2) of people and, when you reach the end, you get to write the next chunk for everyone else to read.

* has markdown support
* has amphibious mouth muscle motion: !(http://asdfasdf.ethz.ch/~simon/bitmap/bugtracker-frog.gif)
