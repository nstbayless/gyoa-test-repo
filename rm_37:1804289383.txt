Hello! You probably came to this page because you were wondering what the heck this is you're looking at.

This is *crowd-written interactive fiction*. Basically, you read a story assembled by a bunch (n&gt;3) of people and, when you reach the end, you get to write the next chunk for everyone else to read.

* has [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) support
* has amphibious mouth muscle motion: ![frog](http://asdfasdf.ethz.ch/~simon/bitmap/bugtracker-frog.gif)

blah blah (this page is under construction)

### The story ###

Is a silly story-within-a-story meta sorta thing that started when some people had some *weird* ideas about what would be a good story.

It is written in the present tense and it is slightly recursive. So far it is mostly told through dialogue and all options indicate a dialogue choice.

These directives are malleable, but be smart.

Have fun. Feel free to vandalize this page.
